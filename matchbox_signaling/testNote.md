# To run hybrid architecture test
This is all still in development. At this point, there are still compiler errors relating to hybrid.rs. 

However, in the best case scenario, we would run the following command to test a valid hybrid architecture:
`cargo test --test hybrid`

To include printouts, include the following:
`cargo test --test hybrid  --  --nocapture`
